# Behavior Cloning

Overview
---
This repository contains files to set up the environment and to execute pytorch models for the task of behavior cloning with the udacity car simulator. 

## How to run

Clone this repo and build the docker image from the Dockerfile inside the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/apereiral-ufg/behavior-cloning.git
cd behavior-cloning
docker build -t carsim .
```
Run a container from the image and forward the port 4567, which is where the simulator publishes its data:
```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 4567:4567 -v "$(pwd)":/workspace carsim:latest
```
After the container is running, open the simulator and click in the autonomous mode.
The simulator can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). 

## Details About Files In This Directory

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py

### `drive.py`

[TODO: update scripts usage]

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.
